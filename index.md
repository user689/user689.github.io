[Twitter Visualizations](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/user689/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/master/twitter_visualization/wrangle_act.html)

In this project, we analyze data obtained from a twitter account called 'WerateDogs' which rates dogs on a scale of 10 (usually in a very absurd way). [Full project is available on Gihub.](https://github.com/user689/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/master/twitter_visualization)

[Medical Records](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/user689/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/master/medical_records/investigating%20medical%20records.html)

The report aims firstly to investigate the Brazilian health care system and to find a number of factors that can lead to the patient not showing for an appointment. For that, the questions to be answered are as follows:

 - What factors are important for knowing if a patient will show up to an appointment or not?
 - How is the problem (not showing for appointments) distributed accross the locations in Brazil?
 - How is the problem distributed across age and gender of patients?
